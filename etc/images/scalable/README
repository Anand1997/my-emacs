Here are the scalable icons that I took from Tango icon theme and the
old Adwaita icon theme.  The goal is to cover all existing Emacs
icons.  I was able to find equivalent or similar icons for half of the
existing icons.  For the rest, I had to create new ones by modify or
combine the icons from Tango and Adwaita.  For a handful or icons I
was unable to find or create new ones for.

Ones that I "created" by modifying/combining other icons:
- bookmark_add
- contact
- data-save
- down
- index
- left-arrow
- letter
- lock-broken
- lock-ok
- lock
- new
- next-node
- next-page
- prev-node
- right-arrow
- saveas
- show
- up-arrow
- up-node
- zoom-in
- zoom-out

I can't find or create new icons for these icons:

- mh-logo
- sort-ascending
- sort-column-ascending
- sort-criteria
- sort-descending
- sort-row-ascending

The following icons didn't need new scalable icons, because they
already have:

- checked
- unchecked

Others are took straight from Tango or Adwaita.
